# Hello! Welcome the COSC 320 Project Repo.
Here you can find the milestone information and contribute to the algorithm source code!
## Topic
Keyword replacement in a corpus: In text analytics, often it is required that a set of keywords are replaced 
with a given set for the documents in hand. For example, on Twitter, people write a lot of abbreviations. When one 
requires to analyze the tweets, (s)he should find all the abbreviations in a given list of abbreviations (e.g. ASAP, 
won’t) and replace all these brief terms in the tweets with its proper phrase/keywords (e.g. ASAP -> As soon as 
possible, or won’t ->  will not).  Your job is  to  design  an  algorithm that  finds  all  of  the  keywords  that  are  in  the 
abbreviation list in each tweet, and then replace them with the appropriate given keyword/phrase. The number of 
tweets  can  be  millions  and  the  list  of  keywords  can  be  hundreds.  A  naïve  approach  is  that  for  each  tweet, your 
algorithm checks for all of the elements in the abbreviated list and replaces them. Other than the naïve approach, 
design a better algorithm and apply the required four steps explained in the first page.  

## Project Proposal 
Project proposal (5% of your project grade):  
 
 
You should: 
- describe your problem in more details, 
- include an example that shows your understanding,  
- edge cases, and  
- any expected complexities.  
- describe your plans of obtaining a real dataset or generate a dataset which enables you to test your dataset.  
- your choice of programming language,  
- timelines, and  
- the separation of tasks among all group members are part of this delivery.  
 
Note that for some topics, you should think about the operations that should be done.

## First Milestone
Project proposal (20% of your project grade):  
 
 
For one of your algorithms: 
- Formulate the problem as an algorithmic problem, include the mathematical notations. For example, given 
an input array A of length n, the algorithm should output A in sorted order.  
- Write pseudo-code.  
- Analyze the algorithm you designed. Include the analysis of the algorithm.  
- Provide proof of correctness and running time of your algorithm. 
- Describe the unexpected Cases/Difficulties. If you encountered any issues for design and implementation 
of your work, include it here. Also, mention the solutions you have considered to alleviate the issue. 
- Note that for some topics, you should think about the operations that should be done.

## Second Milestone
Project proposal (25% of your project grade):  
 
 
For your second algorithm: 
- Formulate the problem as an algorithmic problem, include the mathematical notations. For example, given 
an input array A of length n, the algorithm should output A in sorted order.  
- Write pseudo-code.  
- Analyze the algorithm you designed. Include the analysis of the algorithm.  
- Provide proof of correctness and running time of your algorithm. 
- Data Structure. Choice of your data structure and the rationale behind it. How does it affect the run time or 
memory consumption of your algorithm? 
- Describe the unexpected Cases/Difficulties. If you encountered any issues for design and implementation 
of your work, include it here. Also, mention the solutions you have considered to alleviate the issue. 
- Note that for some topics, you should think about the operations that should be done.  
- Task  Separation and  Responsibilities.  Who  did  what for this  milestone?  Explicitly mention  the  name  of 
group members and their responsibilities.   
 
 
Note: If one person does most of the job, that person will receive more grade. In other words, if you do not contribute 
to the group project, your grade for the project will be different than your group members’. 

## Third Milestone
Project proposal (25% of your project grade):  
 
 
This is the implementation of your first algorithm.  
- Dataset. Include the details of the dataset. 
- Implementation. Explain how you implemented the algorithm and tested it. All the subtle details should be 
included. This is just an explanation and you do not need to copy paste your implementation here. It can be 
as short as one paragraph. Include links if required. 
- Results. Include the plots and the interpretation of the plots as input grows. Compare it to the big O function 
of the running time. For example, if your algorithm runs in O(n^2), show the plot for the n^2  function in 
same  plot  as  well.  Explain  if  this  is  what  you  expected,  and  how  the  implementation  of  your  algorithm 
might have affected the constant values. How the choice of data structure might have affected this result? 
- Unexpected Cases/Difficulties. If you encountered any issues for design and implementation of your work, 
include it here. Also, mention the solutions you have considered to alleviate the issue.  
- Task  Separation and  Responsibilities.  Who  did  what for this  milestone?  Explicitly mention  the  name  of 
group members and their responsibilities.   
 
Note: If one person does most of the job, that person will receive more grade. In other words, if you do not contribute 
to the group project, your grade for the project will be different than your group members’.
